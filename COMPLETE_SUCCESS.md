# ✅ PROJECT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

## 🎉 All Requirements Met

### ✅ Assignment 1 - CrewAI Implementation
- **6 Specialized Agents**: Company Researcher, Market Analyst, Financial Calculator, Risk Assessor, Report Compiler, Quality Validator
- **Sequential + Parallel Execution**: Task 1&2 run in parallel, then 3→4→5→6 sequentially
- **Role-Specific Prompts**: Each agent has detailed prompts tailored to their role
- **Context Sharing**: All agents share context through task dependencies
- **Tool Integration**: Ollama integration for AI responses (no API keys needed!)
- **Structured Output**: Markdown report generated ✅

**Generated Output**: `assignment1_output_Tesla_Inc.md`

### ✅ Assignment 2 - ADK Implementation  
- **Memory System**: MemoryStore class implemented
- **3+ Tools**: Ollama integration + custom financial parser + calculator
- **Parallel Execution**: Threading implemented for parallel task execution
- **Hallucination Mitigation**: Fact-checker agent validates outputs
- **Structured Output**: JSON output with logs ✅
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Complete execution tracking
- **Comparative Document**: COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS.md ✅

**Generated Output**: `assignment2_output_Apple_Inc.json` + `execution.log`
